## ðŸš€ Quick start 

Thanks for checking out my 3 page website!

To install, simply type 'npm i' to install all dependencies via the command line in your preferred IDE

On completion, type 'gatsby develop'

That's it! Visit => http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to view the website.

Notes to developer:
** plus and minus buttons on 'cart' page require further functionality
** subtotal + price on 'cart' page require further functionality
** 'ChangeFlavour' button only outputs to console at current time
